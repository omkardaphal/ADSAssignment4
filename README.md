Assignment 4 - Deep Learning
Due Monday, April 9, 2018

Submission: Put the data and Jupyter notebook files in a folder. Make sure all links to data are relative to the folder so the TAs can run the notebooks.

Deep Learning for analysis of your project data (if possible).
Apply a Deep Learning model to your project data (if possible). You can use another data set ONLY if it makes no sense to use a Deep Learning model for your project.

There will be NO EXTENSIONS on the assingments due in April so start early

Part A - Deep Learning model (40 points)
On your project data

Apply a Deep Learning model to your project data (if possible). Validate the accuracy.
The Deep Learning model can be a CNN, RNN, Autoencoder, Variational autoencoder (VAE), Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), Deep belief network (DBN) or Generative Model. It cannot be a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP).
Part B - Activation function (10 points)
On your Deep Learning model data apply at least two different activation functions.

Change the activation function. How does it effect the accuracy?
How does it effect how quickly the network plateaus?
Various activation functions:
Rectified linear unit (ReLU)
TanH
Leaky rectified linear unit (Leaky ReLU)
Parameteric rectified linear unit (PReLU)
Randomized leaky rectified linear unit (RReLU)
Exponential linear unit (ELU)
Scaled exponential linear unit (SELU)
S-shaped rectified linear activation unit (SReLU)
Identity
Binary step
Logistic
ArcTan
Softsign
Adaptive piecewise linear (APL)
SoftPlus
SoftExponential
Sinusoid
Sinc
Gaussian
Part C - Cost function (10 points)
On your Deep Learning model data at least two different cost functions.

Change the cost function. How does it effect the accuracy?
How does it effect how quickly the network plateaus?
Various forms of cost:
Quadratic cost (mean-square error)
Cross-Entropy
Hinge
Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence
Cosine Proximity
User defined
And many more, see https://keras.io/losses/

Part D - Epochs (10 points)
On your Deep Learning model data

Change the number of epochs initialization. How does it effect the accuracy?
How quickly does the network plateau?
Part E - Gradient estimation (10 points)
On your Deep Learning model data at least two qradient estimation algorithms.

Change the gradient estimation. How does it effect the accuracy?
How does it effect how quickly the network plateaus?
Various forms of gradient estimation:
Stochastic Gradient Descent
Adagrad
RMSProp
ADAM
NAG
Adadelta
Momentum
Part F - Network Architecture (10 points)
On your Deep Learning model data

Change the network architecture. How does it effect the accuracy?
How does it effect how quickly the network plateaus?
Various forms of network architecture:
Number of layers
Size of each layer
Connection type
Pre-trained components?
Part G - Network initialization (10 points)
On your Deep Learning model data at least two network initialization techniques.

Change the network initialization. How does it effect the accuracy?
How does it effect how quickly the network plateaus?
Various forms of network initialization:
